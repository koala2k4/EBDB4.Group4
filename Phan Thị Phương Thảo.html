    <p>Hello! My name is Phuong Thao. I’m a quiet and curious person who loves learning, especially when it comes to history. I enjoy spending time on my own, often getting lost in books or exploring new topics that spark my interest.</p>
    <p>Though I tend to be reserved, I’m always kind and polite to those around me. I treat people with respect, which makes it easy to get along with others, even if I’m not the most talkative in the room.</p>
    <p>My calm and gentle personality helps people feel comfortable around me. When I do share my thoughts, I try to be thoughtful, showing how much I care about understanding things deeply. While I prefer quieter spaces, my friendliness and warm nature make me well-liked by everyone who knows me.</p>
